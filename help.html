          Welcome to the Join help page! This page is your guide to using our Kanban
          project management tool. Here, you'll learn what Join is, how it can
          benefit you, and how to use it to manage your projects more effectively.
        </p>
        <h2>Description of Join</h2>
        <p>
          Join is a project management tool based on the Kanban methodology, created
          by a dedicated group of students during their web development bootcamp at
          Developer Academy. Important Considerations: Join is primarily designed
          for educational purposes and is not intended for extensive enterprise use.
        </p>
        <h2>How does Join work</h2>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Explore the Board:</strong> 
                Upon logging into Join, you'll find a default board
                representing your project with four default lists: "To Do," "In Progress,"
                "Waiting for Feedback," and "Done."
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Create Contacts:</strong> 
                In Join, you can add
                contacts for collaboration. Go to "Contacts," click "New Contact," and
                enter the required information. These contacts can be assigned tasks and
                collaborate on the board.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Add Cards:</strong> 
                After adding contacts, start adding
                cards, which represent tasks. Click the "+" button under the relevant
                list, then fill in task details like name, description, due date,
                assignee, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Move Cards:</strong> 
                As tasks progress, drag and drop cards between
                lists to reflect changes on the board.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Delete Cards:</strong> 
                When a task is
                complete, either move it to the "Done" list or delete it, but be cautious
                as deletion is irreversible.
            </li>
        </ol>
